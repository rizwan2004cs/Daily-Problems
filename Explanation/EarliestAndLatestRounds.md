### Problem Overview

You are given `n` players in a tournament, standing in a row and numbered from 1 to `n`. Each round, the ith player from the front competes against the ith player from the back. If there is an odd number of players, the middle player advances automatically.
Two special players, `firstPlayer` and `secondPlayer`, are the best and will always win until they meet.
**Return:**
An array `[earliest, latest]` representing the earliest and latest possible round numbers in which these two players can compete against each other.

### Approach

- **Simulate all possible outcomes** using recursion and memoization.
- At each round, pair players from the ends inward.
    - If neither player in a pair is `firstPlayer` or `secondPlayer`, you can choose either to win.
    - If `firstPlayer` and `secondPlayer` are paired, record the current round.
- After each round, winners are sorted by their original number.
- Use the current lineup as the memoization key to avoid redundant computation.


### Java Solution

```java
import java.util.*;

class Solution {
    public int[] earliestAndLatest(int n, int firstPlayer, int secondPlayer) {
        int[] res = new int[]{Integer.MAX_VALUE, Integer.MIN_VALUE};
        List<Integer> players = new ArrayList<>();
        for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) players.add(i);
        dfs(players, firstPlayer, secondPlayer, 1, res, new HashSet<>());
        return res;
    }

    private void dfs(List<Integer> players, int a, int b, int round, int[] res, Set<String> memo) {
        int n = players.size();
        int posA = players.indexOf(a), posB = players.indexOf(b);
        if (posA > posB) { int t = posA; posA = posB; posB = t; }
        String key = players.toString() + "|" + round;
        if (memo.contains(key)) return;
        memo.add(key);

        int pairs = n / 2;
        for (int i = 0; i < pairs; i++) {
            int left = i, right = n - 1 - i;
            if ((left == posA && right == posB) || (left == posB && right == posA)) {
                res[0] = Math.min(res[0], round);
                res[1] = Math.max(res[1], round);
                return;
            }
        }

        List<List<Integer>> nextRounds = new ArrayList<>();
        dfsHelper(players, 0, n - 1, a, b, new ArrayList<>(), nextRounds);

        for (List<Integer> next : nextRounds) {
            dfs(next, a, b, round + 1, res, memo);
        }
    }

    private void dfsHelper(List<Integer> players, int l, int r, int a, int b, List<Integer> curr, List<List<Integer>> nextRounds) {
        if (l > r) {
            List<Integer> next = new ArrayList<>(curr);
            Collections.sort(next);
            nextRounds.add(next);
            return;
        }
        if (l == r) {
            curr.add(players.get(l));
            dfsHelper(players, l + 1, r, a, b, curr, nextRounds);
            curr.remove(curr.size() - 1);
            return;
        }
        int left = players.get(l), right = players.get(r);
        if (left == a || right == a) {
            curr.add(a);
            dfsHelper(players, l + 1, r - 1, a, b, curr, nextRounds);
            curr.remove(curr.size() - 1);
        } else if (left == b || right == b) {
            curr.add(b);
            dfsHelper(players, l + 1, r - 1, a, b, curr, nextRounds);
            curr.remove(curr.size() - 1);
        } else {
            curr.add(left);
            dfsHelper(players, l + 1, r - 1, a, b, curr, nextRounds);
            curr.remove(curr.size() - 1);
            curr.add(right);
            dfsHelper(players, l + 1, r - 1, a, b, curr, nextRounds);
            curr.remove(curr.size() - 1);
        }
    }
}
```


### Example

**Input:**
`n = 11, firstPlayer = 2, secondPlayer = 4`
**Output:**
``
**Explanation:**

- They can meet as early as round 3 and as late as round 4, depending on how other matches are resolved.


### Key Points

- **Recursion and memoization** are used to explore all possible outcomes efficiently.
- **State** is represented by the current lineup of players.
- **Complexity is manageable** because `n` is at most 28.

This approach guarantees correct results for all valid inputs within the problem's constraints.
