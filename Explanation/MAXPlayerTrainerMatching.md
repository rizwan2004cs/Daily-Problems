### Problem Overview

Given two integer arrays:

- `players`, where `players[i]` is the ability of the ith player,
- `trainers`, where `trainers[j]` is the capacity of the jth trainer,

A player can be matched with a trainer if the player's ability is less than or equal to the trainer's capacity. Each player and each trainer can be matched at most once.

**Goal:**
Return the maximum number of matchings that satisfy these conditions.

### Solution Approach

The optimal solution uses a **greedy two-pointer technique**:

1. **Sort both arrays** in non-decreasing order.
2. Use two pointers, one for `players` and one for `trainers`.
3. For each player (from weakest to strongest), try to find the first available trainer whose capacity is at least the player's ability.
4. If a match is found, increment both pointers and the match count.
5. If not, move the trainer pointer forward until a suitable trainer is found or all trainers are considered.

This approach ensures that each player is matched with the smallest possible trainer who can accommodate them, maximizing the total number of matchings.

### Java Implementation

```java
import java.util.Arrays;

class Solution {
    public int matchPlayersAndTrainers(int[] players, int[] trainers) {
        Arrays.sort(players);
        Arrays.sort(trainers);
        int i = 0, j = 0, count = 0;
        while (i < players.length && j < trainers.length) {
            if (players[i] <= trainers[j]) {
                count++;
                i++;
                j++;
            } else {
                j++;
            }
        }
        return count;
    }
}
```


### Example

**Input:**
`players = `
`trainers = `

**Process:**

- Sort: `players = `, `trainers = `
- Match 4 with 5 (count = 1)
- Match 7 with 8 (count = 2)
- 9 cannot be matched (no trainer with capacity â‰¥ 9 left)

**Output:**
`2`

### Complexity

- **Time Complexity:** O(n log n + m log m), where n = number of players, m = number of trainers (due to sorting).
- **Space Complexity:** O(1) (ignoring sorting space).


### Key Points

- **Sort both arrays** to enable efficient matching.
- **Greedy matching** ensures the maximum number of pairs.
- Handles large input sizes efficiently.

This approach is standard for problems involving pairing with constraints and is optimal for the given problem.
