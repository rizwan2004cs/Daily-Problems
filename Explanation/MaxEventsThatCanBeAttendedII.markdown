## Problem Overview
Given a list of events, where each event is represented as `[startDay, endDay, value]`, you can attend at most `k` events. You can only attend one event at a time, and you must attend the full duration of each event (end day is inclusive). You cannot attend two events where one starts on the same day another ends. The goal is to maximize the sum of the values of the attended events.

### Example
**Input**:  
`events = [[1,2,4],[3,4,3],[2,3,1]], k = 2`  
**Output**: `7`  
**Explanation**: Attend events `[1,2,4]` and `[3,4,3]` for a total value of `4 + 3 = 7`.

## Solution Approach
The optimal solution uses **Dynamic Programming (DP)** with **Binary Search** to efficiently handle event scheduling and maximize the total value.

### Steps
1. **Sort Events**:  
   Sort the events by `startDay` to process them in chronological order.
2. **DP State**:  
   Define `dp[i][j]` as the maximum value achievable by considering events from index `i` onward with `j` events left to attend.
3. **Choices for Each Event**:  
   - **Skip**: Skip the current event and move to the next (`dp[i+1][j]`).  
   - **Take**: Attend the current event, find the next non-overlapping event using binary search (start day > current event’s end day), and add the current event’s value (`value[i] + dp[next][j-1]`).
4. **Recurrence**:  
   `dp[i][j] = max(dp[i+1][j], value[i] + dp[next][j-1])`  
   where `next` is the index of the next non-overlapping event.
5. **Binary Search**:  
   Use binary search to find the earliest event whose `startDay` is greater than the current event’s `endDay`.

## C++ Solution
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int maxValue(vector<vector<int>>& events, int k) {
        // Sort events by start day
        sort(events.begin(), events.end());
        int n = events.size();
        // Initialize memoization table with -1
        vector<vector<int>> memo(n, vector<int>(k + 1, -1));
        return dfs(events, 0, k, memo);
    }
    
    int dfs(vector<vector<int>>& events, int i, int k, vector<vector<int>>& memo) {
        // Base cases: no more events or no more events to attend
        if (i == events.size() || k == 0) return 0;
        // Return memoized result if available
        if (memo[i][k] != -1) return memo[i][k];
        
        // Option 1: Skip current event
        int skip = dfs(events, i + 1, k, memo);
        // Option 2: Take current event, find next non-overlapping event
        int next = binarySearch(events, i);
        int take = events[i][2] + dfs(events, next, k - 1, memo);
        
        // Store and return maximum of skip and take
        memo[i][k] = max(skip, take);
        return memo[i][k];
    }
    
    int binarySearch(vector<vector<int>>& events, int prev) {
        int left = prev + 1, right = events.size();
        int prevEndDay = events[prev][1];
        while (left < right) {
            int mid = left + (right - left) / 2;
            if (events[mid][0] > prevEndDay) right = mid;
            else left = mid + 1;
        }
        return left;
    }
};
```

## Key Points
- **Time Complexity**: `O(n * k * log n)`, where `n` is the number of events and `k` is the maximum number of events to attend. Sorting takes `O(n log n)`, and for each of `O(n * k)` DP states, binary search takes `O(log n)`.
- **Space Complexity**: `O(n * k)` for the memoization table.
- **Binary Search**: Efficiently finds the next non-overlapping event by searching for the earliest event with `startDay > prevEndDay`.
- **Flexibility**: You don’t need to attend exactly `k` events; attending fewer may yield a higher total value if events overlap.

## Example Usage
```cpp
vector<vector<int>> events = {{1,2,4},{3,4,3},{2,3,1}};
int k = 2;
// Output: 7
```

This solution is efficient, optimal, and handles large inputs effectively. It uses dynamic programming with memoization and binary search to avoid redundant computations and quickly find non-overlapping events.
