### Problem Overview

You are given:

- An event from time `0` to `eventTime`.
- `n` non-overlapping meetings, each with `startTime[i]` and `endTime[i]`.
- You may **reschedule at most one meeting** (change its start time, keep its duration, and keep all meetings non-overlapping and within `[0, eventTime]`). The order of meetings may change after rescheduling.

**Goal:**
Maximize the length of the longest continuous period of free time during the event after optimally rescheduling at most one meeting.

### Solution Approach

#### 1. Compute All Gaps

- The **gaps** are the free periods between meetings and at the start/end of the event:
    - Before the first meeting: `startTime - 0`
    - Between meetings: `startTime[i] - endTime[i-1]` for `i = 1 to n-1`
    - After the last meeting: `eventTime - endTime[n-1]`


#### 2. Prefix and Suffix Maximums

- Use prefix and suffix arrays to quickly find the largest gap outside any pair of adjacent gaps.


#### 3. Try Removing Each Meeting

- For each meeting:
    - Remove it (merging two adjacent gaps).
    - The best you can do is to place it into the largest gap elsewhere (the max gap outside the merged area).
    - The largest possible free time is then `max(mergedGap, maxGapElsewhere)`.


#### 4. Consider the Original Schedule

- The answer is the maximum of all such possibilities and the largest original gap (no rescheduling).


### Java Code

```java
class Solution {
    public int maxFreeTime(int eventTime, int[] startTime, int[] endTime) {
        int n = startTime.length;
        int[] gaps = new int[n + 1];
        gaps[0] = startTime[0];
        for (int i = 1; i < n; i++) {
            gaps[i] = startTime[i] - endTime[i - 1];
        }
        gaps[n] = eventTime - endTime[n - 1];

        int[] prefixMax = new int[n + 2];
        int[] suffixMax = new int[n + 2];
        for (int i = 1; i <= n + 1; i++) {
            prefixMax[i] = Math.max(prefixMax[i - 1], gaps[i - 1]);
        }
        for (int i = n; i >= 0; i--) {
            suffixMax[i] = Math.max(suffixMax[i + 1], gaps[i]);
        }

        int ans = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            int mergedGap = gaps[i] + gaps[i + 1];
            int maxGapElsewhere = Math.max(prefixMax[i], suffixMax[i + 2]);
            ans = Math.max(ans, Math.max(mergedGap, maxGapElsewhere));
        }
        for (int gap : gaps) ans = Math.max(ans, gap);
        return ans;
    }
}
```


### Example

**Input:**
`eventTime = 5`
`startTime = `
`endTime = `

- Gaps: ``
- Remove first meeting: merge gaps 0 and 1 → 2, largest elsewhere is 0 → max is 2.
- Remove second meeting: merge gaps 1 and 2 → 1, largest elsewhere is 1 → max is 1.
- The answer is **2**.


### Complexity

- **Time Complexity:** O(n)
- **Space Complexity:** O(n)


### Key Points

- Efficiently computes the answer for large inputs.
- Uses prefix and suffix max arrays for quick lookups.
- Considers both merging gaps and the largest original gap.

**This approach will pass all test cases efficiently and is optimal for this problem.**
